# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

*Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.*

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```
# Quickstart
**Ways to use:**
- Have to use  module `coursera.py` after `python3`.
